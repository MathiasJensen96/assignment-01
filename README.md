Grab your toothbrush with your right hand. Grab the toothpaste with your left hand. Open the toothpaste with your left thumb. Squice the toothpaste over the toothbrush hairs until they are covored. Close the toothpaste again and put it back on the shelf. Now put a bit of water on top of the toothbrush and stick it in your mouth. Not start brushing the top of your teeth. This is done by moving the toothbrush back and forth on the surface of the teeth. Next you do the same but with the bottom teeth.
